# Go POS Implementation Plan

Based on the database schema analysis and PRD requirements, here's the structured implementation roadmap:

## Database Schema Analysis

The project has a comprehensive 24-table schema covering:
- **Core entities**: roles, users, products, customers, suppliers
- **Transaction management**: sales, sale_items, purchases, inventory_movements  
- **Configuration tables**: payment_methods, sale_statuses, product_categories
- **Advanced inventory tracking**: inventory_levels with automatic stock deduction
- **FIFO Cost Management**: product_cost_lots for accurate COGS and profit calculations
- **Financial records**: transaction_payments, receipt_templates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Priority: Must Have**

1. **Database Layer**
   - Set up PostgreSQL connection using existing `internal/platform/database/connection.go`
   - Implement SQLC models for core entities (users, roles, products, customers)
   - Create database migration system using goose (schema files are ready)

2. **Authentication & Session Management**
   - Implement user login/logout using existing `internal/app/middleware/session.go`
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Cashier)
   - Session persistence with Redis cache

3. **Basic Product Management**
   - CRUD operations for products (name, SKU, price, category)
   - Product categories management
   - Basic product search functionality

### Phase 2: Core POS Functionality (Week 3-4)
**Priority: Must Have**

1. **Sales Transaction Engine**
   - Shopping cart implementation with HTMX
   - Add/remove items, quantity adjustments
   - Real-time price calculation
   - Multiple payment method support

2. **Inventory Integration**
   - FIFO (First-In, First-Out) cost tracking using product_cost_lots
   - Automatic stock deduction on sales with accurate COGS calculation
   - Real-time inventory level display with cost information
   - Low stock warnings with cost analysis

3. **Receipt Generation**
   - Digital receipt templates
   - Print-ready formatting
   - Email receipt functionality

### Phase 3: Management Features (Week 5-6)
**Priority: Should Have**

1. **Customer Management**
   - Customer registration during checkout
   - Purchase history tracking
   - Walk-in customer support

2. **Reporting Dashboard**
   - Daily/weekly/monthly sales reports
   - Top-selling products
   - Transaction volume analytics
   - Cash drawer reconciliation

3. **Advanced Sales Features**
   - Hold/retrieve sales
   - Refunds and exchanges
   - Discount application (percentage/fixed)

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Week 7-8)
**Priority: Could Have**

1. **Enhanced Inventory**
   - Manual stock adjustments with cost lot management
   - Purchase order tracking with FIFO cost allocation
   - Supplier management with cost history
   - Expiration date tracking for perishable goods
   - Comprehensive cost lot reporting and analysis

2. **System Configuration**
   - Store settings (name, address, tax rates)
   - Receipt template customization
   - User role permissions

3. **Performance & UX**
   - Barcode scanning integration
   - Quick-pick product lists
   - Mobile-responsive design

## Technology Stack Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Chi router (already configured)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLC
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions
- **Templates**: Go html/template with HTMX

### Frontend Stack
- **UI Framework**: HTMX + TailwindCSS
- **JavaScript**: Minimal jQuery for barcode scanning
- **Templates**: Go templ for type-safe templates

## Starting Point Recommendations

### 1. Begin with Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations
goose -dir sql/schema postgres "connection_string" up
```

### 2. Core Entity Models
Start with these critical entities:
- `users` and `roles` (authentication)
- `products` and `product_categories` (catalog)
- `product_cost_lots` (FIFO inventory costing)
- `sales` and `sale_items` (transactions)
- `inventory_levels` (stock tracking)

### 3. Essential Handlers
Implement in this order:
1. `auth.go` - login/logout endpoints
2. `products.go` - product CRUD
3. `sales.go` - transaction processing
4. `reports.go` - basic analytics

### 4. Critical Frontend Pages
1. Login page (already exists at `web/template/views/login.html`)
2. POS interface (main selling screen)
3. Product management
4. Daily reports dashboard

## Success Metrics for V1

- **Performance**: Transaction processing < 2 seconds
- **Reliability**: Handle 100 products, 1000 daily transactions
- **Usability**: Minimal training required for cashiers
- **Security**: Role-based access, encrypted credentials

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Payment Processing**: Use existing payment_methods table for flexibility
2. **Hardware Integration**: Implement web-based barcode scanning first
3. **Data Integrity**: Use PostgreSQL transactions for sale processing with FIFO cost allocation
4. **Cost Accuracy**: Ensure proper FIFO implementation to maintain accurate COGS and profit margins
5. **Scalability**: Design for single-store first, multi-store later

This implementation plan prioritizes core POS functionality while building toward the comprehensive feature set defined in the PRD.
